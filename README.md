# Model Evaluation and Selection with TensorFlow

This project evaluates six different combinations of optimizers and loss functions using TensorFlow models to determine the best-performing combination based on test accuracy.

## Features
- **Model Evaluation**: Trains and evaluates models with different optimizers and loss functions.
- **Result Visualization**: Displays the results as a formatted table (dataframe) and saves the best model.
- **Predictions**: Users can interactively test the model at the notebook's end by modifying the index. This makes the workflow more engaging and user-friendly.
